 * 
 * Pages are typically used to formulate the ideal routing of an application,
 * by situating css, jsx, and js files into a folder that is named after the page.
 * 
 * For example:
 * ./pages/home/home.jsx
 * ./pages/home/home.css
 * ./pages/home/home.test.js
 * 
 * The pages folder is used to store all the pages of the application. Please use it as such, or configure it to your liking.
